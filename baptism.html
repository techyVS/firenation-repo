							Being baptized by immersion is a priority in the lives of
							Christians. It’s a major ordinance and standard set by God through
							His son Jesus Christ. After we have accepted salvation in our
							hearts and confessed Him with our mouths, God expects us to
							demonstrate what we have believed and identify with the death and
							resurrection of our savior, Jesus Christ through water Baptism.
							Jesus says, you can never enter into the Kingdom of God unless you
							are baptized.
						</p>

						<p class="text">
							This you can read more at John 3:1-6. 1. Now there was a Pharisee,
							a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling
							council. 2 He came to Jesus at night and said, “Rabbi, we
							know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one
							could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him.”
							3 Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, no one can see the
							kingdom of God unless they are born again.[a]” 4 “How can someone
							be born when they are old?” Nicodemus asked. “Surely they cannot
							enter a second time into their mother’s womb to be born!” 5 Jesus
							answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of
							God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. 6 Flesh gives
							birth to flesh, but the Spirit[b] gives birth to spirit.

								<p>
									<strong>Matthew 28: 19-20 19</strong> "Therefore go and make
									disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
									Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20. and teaching
									them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am
									with you always, to the very end of the age.”
								</p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
								<p>
									<strong>Romans 8:11 11</strong> "And if the Spirit of him who
									raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised
									Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies
									because of[a] his Spirit who lives in you.
								</p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>

								<p>
									<strong>Mark 16:15-16 15</strong> He said to them, “Go into
									all the world and preach the gospel to all
									creation. 16 Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved,
									but whoever does not believe will be condemned.
								</p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
								<p>
									<strong>Acts 2:38 38</strong> Peter replied, “Repent and be
									baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for
									the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of
									the Holy Spirit.
								</p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
								<p>
									<strong>Acts 2:41 41</strong> Those who accepted his message
									were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their
									number that day.
								</p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
								<p>
									<strong>Romans 6:3-4 3</strong> Or don’t you know that all of
									us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his
									death? 4 We were therefore buried with him through baptism
									into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the
									dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new
									life.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="text">
							In order to fulfill this ordinance, we preach the gospel to all
							and conduct baptism once every month. If you have received the
							gospel but have not yet fulfilled your baptismal ordinance, we
							would like to have the privilege of baptizing you.
