							What does it take to begin a relationship with God? Do you need to
							devote yourself to unselfish religious deeds? Must you be a better
							person before approaching God or for God to accept you? It may
							surprise you that none of these things may work. However, God has
							made it very clear in the Bible how we can know Him. <br />
							<br />

							The following principles will explain how YOU can PERSONALLY begin
							a relationship with GOD, right now, through JESUS CHRIST.

							<br /><br />
							<strong>PRINCIPLE ONE</strong>
							<br />
							<strong
								><em
									>God loves you and offers a wonderful plan for your life.</em
								></strong
							>

              <br><br>

              <strong>God's love...</strong>
              <br>
              <blockquote>“God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life” (John 3:16).</blockquote>

              <br><br>

              <strong>God's plan...</strong>
              <br>
              <blockquote>Jesus said, “I came that they might have life, and might have it abundantly” (John 10:10) — that is, that life might be full and meaningful.</blockquote>

              <br><br>
              Why is it that most people are not experiencing the abundant life? Because...


              <br><br><br>


              <strong>PRINCIPLE TWO</strong>
              <br>
              <strong><em>All of us inherited sin, and our sin has separated us from God.</em></strong>

              <br><br>

              <strong>We are sinful...</strong>
              <br>
              <blockquote>“All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23).</blockquote>

              <br><br>

              We were created to have fellowship with God, but because of our stubborn self-will, we chose to go our own way, and our fellowship with God was broken. This self-will, characterized by an attitude of active rebellion or passive indifference, is what the Bible calls sin.

								<br><br>
              <strong>We are separated...</strong>
              <br>
              <blockquote>“The wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23). Death is spiritual separation from God.

              <br>

              The image above illustrates that God is holy and people are sinful. A great gulf separates us. We are continually trying to reach God and the abundant life through our own efforts, such as a good life, philosophy, or religion, but we inevitably fail.
              
              <br><br>

              <strong>The third principle explains the only way to bridge this gulf...</strong>

              <br><br><br>

							
							<strong>PRINCIPLE THREE</strong>
							<br>
							<strong><em>Jesus Christ is God's only provision for our sin. Through Him we can know and experience God's love and plan for our lives</em></strong>

							<br><br>
							<strong>He died in our place...</strong>
							<blockquote>“God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8).</blockquote>

							<br><br>

							<strong>He rose from the dead...</strong>
							<blockquote>“Christ died for our sins ... He was buried ... He was raised on the third day, according to the Scriptures ... He appeared to Peter, then to the twelve. After that He appeared to more than five hundred.” (1 Corinthians 15:3-6).</blockquote>
							<br><br>

							<strong>He is the only way to God</strong>
							<blockquote>“Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but through Me'” (John 14:6).</blockquote>

							<br><br>

							God has bridged the gulf that separates us from Him by sending His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross in our place to pay the penalty for our sins.

							<br><br><br>

							<strong>PRINCIPLE FOUR</strong>
							<br>
							<strong>
								<em>We must individually receive Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord; then we can know and experience God's love and plan for our lives.</em>
							</strong>

							<br><br>
							<strong>We must receive Christ...</strong>
							<br>
							<blockquote>“As many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even to those who believe in His name” (John 1:12).</blockquote>

							<br><br>
							<strong>We receive Christ through Faith</strong> <br>
							<blockquote>“By grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, that no one should boast” (Ephesians 2:8-9).</blockquote>

							<br>  When we receive Christ, we experience a new birth.

							<br><br>

							<strong>We receive Christ through personal invitation</strong>
							<br>
							<blockquote>Jesus says, “Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any one hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him” (Revelation 3:20).</blockquote>

							<br>

							Receiving Christ involves turning to God from self (repentance) and trusting Christ to come into our lives to forgive our sins and to make us what He wants us to be. Just to accept completely that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He died on the cross for your sins is not enough. Nor is it enough to have emotional experience. You receive Jesus Christ by faith, as an act of the will.

							<br><br>

							You can receive Christ right now by faith through a sincere prayer.
Now, prayer is communication with God. God knows your heart and is not so concerned with your words as He is with the attitude of your heart.
Below is a prayer that can help you reconcile and connect to God. If this sincere prayer expresses the desires of your heart, then you can pray this prayer right now and believe that Christ will come into your life, as He promised.

<br> <br>

							<strong><em>Dear God in heaven, I come to you in the name of Jesus. I acknowledge to You that I am a sinner, and I am sorry for my sins and the life that I have lived; I need your forgiveness.</em></strong>

							<br><br>

							<strong><em>I believe that your only begotten Son Jesus Christ shed His precious blood on the cross at Calvary and died for my sins, and I am now willing to turn from my sin.</em></strong>

							<br><br>

							<strong><em>You said in the bible that if we confess the Lord our God and believe in our hearts that God raised Jesus from the dead, we shall be saved.</em></strong>

							<br><br>

							<strong><em>Right now I confess Jesus as my Lord. With my heart, I believe that God raised Jesus from the dead. This very moment I accept Jesus Christ as my own personal Savior and according to His Word, right now I am saved. Amen.</em></strong>
