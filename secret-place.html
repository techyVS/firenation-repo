									>Psalms 91:1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most
									High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
								</em></strong
							>

							<br />
							<br />
							The most powerful place in the kingdom of God and in the kingdom
							of darkness is the secret place. What happens in the secret place,
							controls what happens in the public place. The Secret place is a
							private retreat/prayer alters for serious Christians or
							individuals who desire an uninterrupted time with God. We are
							building the most serene, spirit-filled and creative environment
							that will connect you easily to your CREATOR.

							<br />
							<br />
							Jesus Himself modeled retreating when he’d leave the crowds to be
							by himself to spend time in prayer and with His Father, for
							example:

							<br />
							<br />

							Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up,
							left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.
							– Mark 1:35

							<br />
							<br />
							But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed. – Luke 5:16
							<br />
							<br />

							One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and
							spent the night praying to God. – Luke 6:12

							<br />
							<br />

							<strong
								>What you may experience when you retreat at THE SECRET
								PLACE</strong
							>
							<br />
							<br />

							<ul class="ul">
								<li><strong>1. A closer walk with God</strong> <br> When you are immersed in focused Bible teaching, study, and reflection, the Holy Spirit will bring you closer to God. By omitting competition for your time, attention, and energy, pursuing God and His character becomes paramount while on retreat, which inevitably brings you closer to Him. </li>

								<li><strong>2. Closer relationships with others</strong> <br> Getting away with friends and family is important for your relationships. While on retreat with very few distractions, you’re more available to engage with those you love and bond with them over shared experiences, which leads to greater intimacy and growth.</li>
								<li><strong>3. Learning more about yourself</strong> <br> It’s easy to get caught up in our routines and the many hats we wear. In “everyday life,” we may be Mom, Boss, Husband, Employee — or any number of other roles. While on retreat, we step outside others’ expectations of us, and we can put away any definitions we’ve been clinging to that outline culture’s demands. On retreat, we can explore our identity in Christ and our relationship with Him.</li>

								<li><strong>4. Greater clarity about God’s call</strong> <br> Hearing from God is sometimes not easy in our busy, noisy world. Our centre is surrounded by quiet and intentional Bible study, is very conducive for building your relationship with God. When you are closer to God, you know more about His character, His will, and you’re more apt to desire those things that He desires. You can also hear from Him more clearly. </li>

								<li><strong>5. Appreciation for the beauty of God’s creation</strong> <br> The Secret Place is located in a beautiful and natural environment. God’s creation is breath-taking, and spending time in nature can often inspire one to praise their Creator: “The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands” (Psalm 19).</li>
								
								<li><strong>6. Rest</strong> <br> We humans are not made to go, go, go. We need rest to be fully healthy and productive. God Himself modeled the value of rest by establishing a rhythm of work and rest at Creation. He gives us an entire day for rest each week. <br> Going on retreat can have a true restorative and healing effect, offering an opportunity to unplug, de-stress, and rest.</li>
							</ul>
