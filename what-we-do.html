							Through researches, we have found out that many Christians in
							remote communities don’t even have bibles or study materials. In
							some cases, a whole church will have just one bible which the
							minister or Pastor goes home with for his personal study. What is
							a Christian life without the study of God’s word? Based on this,
							we decided to supply bibles and tracks free to new converts as
							well as communities in need of God’s word (The Bible)

								<ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>

								We purchase hardback or vinyl Bibles with pages that are glued

								cheaper, but will not last.

								<ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
								<p>
									We print a minimum of 500,000 tracts annually in 5 major

							Being baptized by immersion is a priority in the lives of
							Christians. It’s a major ordinance and standard set by God through
							His son Jesus Christ. After we have accepted salvation in our
							hearts and confessed Him with our mouths, God expects us to
							demonstrate what we have believed and identify with the death and
							resurrection of our savior, Jesus Christ through water Baptism.
							Jesus says, you can never enter into the Kingdom of God unless you
							are baptized.
						</p>

						<p class="text">
							This you can read more at John 3:1-6. 1. Now there was a Pharisee,
							a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling
							council. 2 He came to Jesus at night and said, “Rabbi, we
							know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one
							could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him.”
							3 Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, no one can see the
							kingdom of God unless they are born again.[a]” 4 “How can someone
							be born when they are old?” Nicodemus asked. “Surely they cannot
							enter a second time into their mother’s womb to be born!” 5 Jesus
							answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of
							God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. 6 Flesh gives
							birth to flesh, but the Spirit[b] gives birth to spirit.

									<strong>Matthew 28: 19-20 19</strong> "Therefore go and make

									Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20. and teaching
									them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am
									with you always, to the very end of the age.”

								<ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>

									<strong>Romans 8:11 11</strong> "And if the Spirit of him who

									Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies
									because of[a] his Spirit who lives in you.
								</p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>

								<p>
									<strong>Mark 16:15-16 15</strong> He said to them, “Go into
									all the world and preach the gospel to all
									creation. 16 Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved,
									but whoever does not believe will be condemned.
								</p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
								<p>
									<strong>Acts 2:38 38</strong> Peter replied, “Repent and be
									baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for
									the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of
									the Holy Spirit.
								</p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>

									<strong>Acts 2:41 41</strong> Those who accepted his message
									were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their
									number that day.
								</p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
								<p>
									<strong>Romans 6:3-4 3</strong> Or don’t you know that all of
									us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his
									death? 4 We were therefore buried with him through baptism
									into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the
									dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new
									life.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="text">
							In order to fulfill this ordinance, we preach the gospel to all
							and conduct baptism once every month. If you have received the
							gospel but have not yet fulfilled your baptismal ordinance, we
							would like to have the privilege of baptizing you.

						<p class="text">
							No one encounters God and remains same. Shekinah is an atmosphere
							where the tangible presence of God is experienced through deep
							worship and koinonia with God’s word. After God’s servant, Moses
							experienced the Shekinah Glory, he was feared by all and God did
							mighty works with him all the days of his life. <br />
							<br />
							Exodus 34: 29-35 29 When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the
							two tablets of the covenant law in his hands, he was not aware
							that his face was radiant because he had spoken with
							the Lord. 30 When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, his face
							was radiant, and they were afraid to come near him. 31 But Moses
							called to them; so Aaron and all the leaders of the community came
							back to him, and he spoke to them. 32 Afterward all the Israelites
							came near him, and he gave them all the commands the Lord had
							given him on Mount Sinai.
						</p>

						<p class="text">
							33 When Moses finished speaking to them, he put a veil over his
							face. 34 But whenever he entered the Lord’s presence to speak with
							him, he removed the veil until he came out. And when he came out
							and told the Israelites what he had been commanded, 35 they saw
							that his face was radiant. Then Moses would put the veil back over
							his face until he went in to speak with the Lord.

							Worship known as SHACHAH in Hebrew means to bow down or to fall
							down flat. It’s that moment we humble ourselves before YAHWEH.
							Worship is a divine moment of total reference to God. It’s that
							moment we withdraw completely from everything about self but
							absolute focus on Yahweh. When we allow Yahweh’s Spirit have
							unhindered flow through our spirit-man, our lives changes from
							inside-out. It’s no doubt that the spiritual controls the
							physical.

						<p class="text">
							NIGHT OF WORSHIP (NOW) is that moment we worship God in SPIRIT and
							TRUTH as seen in John 4: 23-24 23 But the hour cometh, and now is,
							when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and
							in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. 24 God is a
							Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and

							We place them on our mostly feeding program and in some cases; we
							train them on skills that can also empower them, fund the
							enterprise and put smiles on their faces thereby letting them know
							that if the society forgets them, God will never forget them. The
							second group of individuals we minister help to, are prostitutes.
							We present the message of salvation to prostitutes and then
							further train them in a profitable skill/enterprise as a better
							option for livelihood after they must have based through proper
							discipleship.

							answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed
							thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? 38 When saw we thee a
							stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? 39 Or when
							saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? 40 And the
